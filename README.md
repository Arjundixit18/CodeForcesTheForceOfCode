**A personal odyssey through the algorithmic universe of Codeforces** 🌌

*Where bugs become features and TLE becomes a way of life* 😅

## 🎯 What's This All About?

Welcome to my coding dojo! This repo is where I document my journey through Codeforces problems - from the "wait, that was easy?" moments to the "why did I choose this life?" breakdowns. 

Every solution here represents hours of thinking, debugging, and occasionally talking to my rubber duck 🦆.

## 🛠️ My Arsenal

**Languages I Fight With:**
- 🐍 **Python** - My trusty companion for quick prototypes
- ⚡ **C++** - When I need that extra speed (and extra headaches)

**Tools of the Trade:**
- VS Code with way too many extensions
- Competitive Programming Helper
- A lot of patience and coffee ☕

## 📈 Learning Journey

### 🎯 Current Goals
- [ ] Solve 200+ problems
- [ ] Master dynamic programming (still working on it...)
- [ ] Stop getting TLE on easy problems 😅

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- **Always read the problem twice** (learned this the hard way)
- **Edge cases are everywhere** (0, 1, and maximum values are your enemies)
- **When in doubt, brute force it out** (then optimize)

## 💡 Pro Tips for Fellow Coders

1. **Read editorials** - Even if you solve it, there might be a cleaner approach
2. **Practice consistently** - 30 minutes daily > 5 hours once a week
3. **Don't be afraid to fail** - Every WA is a lesson in disguise
4. **Participate in contests** - Real-time pressure builds character
